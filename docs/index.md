# Welcome

This is Fanrri's blog.

There're too many stuff on the way! This website is currently on it's first step and I'm slowly process it since I'm busy on others. I'm in high school and live on campus, so I can't update things promptly, leave me a message via email please: `FanrriMe@gmail.com`. The web server is now on Github Page, you can also browse this page through [my own domain](blog.fanrri.me), I'll deploy this project locally soon to make it accessable in China Mainland.

I'd rather make the page full in English to make it easier to handle till someday I found that I still prefer to use Chinese. The main project I'm focus on is my Minecraft server FIS Fishing Craft, I'd like to show some details about this project in my blog, also as the documents of it.

Thank's for your visiting.
